## NOTES and IDEAS

I was thinking the goal of this study would be to perform a general review of coastal conditions following the removal of two dams from the Elwha River in Washington. This would include elementary review of stream dischange at available stations, sediment transport at the estuary, and species distributions and abundances. Some additional interesting questions to consider could be the use of eDNA for tracking fish movement or determining food chain transformations.

USGS report that is super helpful (PDF in folder): chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2011/5120/pdf/sir20115120.pdf

A general structure of the study could include:
1. Watershed analysis: streamflow at available USGS gage site, estuary sediment transport
2. Comparing water quality metrics before and after dam removal, literature review may be required to put these values in context
3. Mapping and comparing species distribution/abundance before and after dam removal
4. Mapping and comparing eDNA and species distribution/abundance

Available data:
- eDNA shedding from live and dead fish
- Estuarian fish
- Estuarian riparian veg abundance
- Estuarian riparian veg richness
- Estuarian sediment
- Estuarian WQ
- eDNA in fish post-removal

Data we need to gather or find:
- USGS Gage Station #12045500
- USGS Gage Station #12044900
- Watershed spatial data

Some maps I think would be useful:
Map 1. Elwha River watershed including major tributaries, dams, USGS monitoring stations, and an inset map showing the general location in Washington
Map 2-n. Sample collection sites for organism studies. This could be an interactive map.
Map n+1: Might be interested in showing the spatial species distributions if we find anything of note? This could be an interactive map. 

Some figures I think would be useful:
- Streamflow at both sites as a function of time
- Species comparisons before and after dam removal
