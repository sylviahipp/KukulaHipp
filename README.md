## Summary

This repository contains all materials (data, analysis, final report) used to assess the environmental impacts of the removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams along the Elwha River in Washington State.

Removal of the Elwha River dams began in 2011 and concluded in 2014. This repository contains several datasets measuring environmental impacts before removal (2006–2011), during removal (2011–2014), and after removal (2014–2017). Data were collected from a range of sources, including the USGS Water Data for the Nation repository and academic publications available through the USGS ScienceBase repository. Our analysis (and the associated datasets) focuses on environmental impacts in four main areas: streamflow, sediment levels, water quality, and salmon diet.
