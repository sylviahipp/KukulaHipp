    <descript>
      <abstract>We collected environmental DNA (eDNA) data from the Elwha River, home to the world’s largest dam removal project, to track the spatial and temporal patterns of species responses following dam removal. In total, we collected data for 11 different fish taxa, sampled at 25 sites ranging across 56 river kilometers in a wilderness river for 4 years following dam removal. We show that eDNA can effectively be used to determine whether fish have recolonized past former dams, and in some cases determine the spatial extent of that recolonization.</abstract>
      <purpose>The goal was to develop and test the use of species specific eDNA assays to detect patterns of fish species responses following dam removal.</purpose>

        <procdesc>We established a network of 25 eDNA field sampling locations throughout 56 rkm of the main stem Elwha River (n = 14 sites) and in 10 major tributaries (n = 11 sites). From 2014 to 2017, sampling occurred downstream of Elwha Dam (hereafter LE; n = 2 sites) and in-between the dams (hereafter ME; n = 8 sites) in areas accessible by road. All sites upstream of the Glines Canyon Dam (hereafter UE; n = 15 sites) were in roadless backcountry, with the sites in Mills and Geyser Valley floodplains requiring a full day hike for access and sampling. For sites near roads or accessible by foot in a day, we collected eDNA samples approximately monthly for the duration of the study (with some exceptions). For sites that required multi-day backpacking trips, we conducted sampling in one month during summer base flows (August or September). The number of sampling occasions at each site ranged from 3 to 33 (Table 3). Resource limitations during early project sampling in 2014 and the winter of 2015 precluded monthly sampling, which began in March of 2015 and continued until December 2017. Weather events and logistical issues precluded sampling during 4 of these time periods in December 2015 and February, March, and November of 2017.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>For each water sampling event, individually bagged sampling kits containing a filter funnel loaded with a filter, unused 475 ml plastic cup, forceps, applicator stick (to help fold the filter), gloves, and 5 ml tube with ethanol were prepared prior to field sampling and care was taken to avoid cross-sample contamination in the field. We sterilized all filter funnels and forceps prior to their use by soaking in 10% bleach for at least 10 minutes followed by rinsing with filtered water.

To survey eDNA, we collected three replicate 1-L sub-surface water samples at each site and filtered the water through a pre-sterilized 47 mm diameter Nalgene filter funnel with a 0.45 µm pore size cellulose nitrate sterile filter membrane (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA). The filter funnel was connected to a Masterflex L/S Easy-Load peristaltic pump powered by a 12 v cordless screwdriver. After filtration, filters were removed from the funnel and placed in sterile 5 ml tubes containing 95 % ethanol and then stored at -20 degrees C until DNA extraction.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The eDNA workflow and sample preparation was separated into designated work rooms including a clean room where DNA was extracted (no amplified PCR products or highly concentrated target DNA sequences allowed), a second room where qPCR reagents and mastermixes were prepared and loaded, a third room where DNA standards and highly concentrated DNA was diluted and loaded, and a fourth room dedicated to PCR amplification. Sample preparation was performed in UV hoods (except for PCR amplification) using equipment dedicated to processing eDNA samples at each workstation. Workstations were decontaminated with UV and/or 10 % bleach before and after each use.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Filter and mesocosm samples were air dried to allow ethanol to evaporate and then each filter was cut into 2 mm wide strips with sterile scissors and incubated in lysis buffer for one hour at 55 °C. DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen) with the following modifications: 360 µl ATL buffer and 40 µl of Proteinase K were used for cell lysis and the volume of AL buffer and 100% ethanol was adjusted to 400 µl post-lysis. DNA was eluted in 200 µl AE buffer and stored at -20 oC until qPCR analysis.

All DNA extracted from water samples were tested first for the presence of PCR inhibitors by performing an internal positive control (IPC) assay using TaqMan Exogenous Internal Positive Control Reagents (EXO-IPC) (Applied Biosystems). Each DNA sample was run in duplicate and each IPC assay was performed in 10 µl volumes consisting of 5 µl of Gene Expression Master Mix, 1 µl EXO-IPC mix, 0.2 µl EXO-IPC DNA, and 3 µl DNA template or sterile water for the non-template control (NTC) using the default cycle parameters with 40 cycles. Environmental samples were considered inhibited when samples at &gt; 3 cycle threshold (Ct) shift relative to the mean NTC. Samples that were inhibited were treated with OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, California) and re-tested with the IPC assay to confirm that PCR inhibition was alleviated.

We used the 11 fish eDNA assays to interrogate DNA extracted from the Elwha River water samples. All qPCR assays were performed in triplicate on each sample. 

Ct values for each sample replicate were summarized to a binary detection/non-detection value of 1 or 0, respectively. We considered a positive detection as any sample amplifying at less than 40 Ct with a uniform curve morphology, as suggested by Klymus et al. (2019).</procdesc>

      <eaover>The data described in this metadata record can be found in the publication in Environmental DNA by Duda et al. This paper describes a projects that uses environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect eleven fish speces in the Elwha River and selected tributaries following dam remova. The data for these projects are contained in a single text file described in this metadata record, that provides the presence/non-detection for replicate water samples at 25 sites over a four year period.</eaover>
