        <procdesc>For our analysis we included the MODIS Aqua MYD02QKM Level 1B Calibrated, Geolocated Radiance/Reflectance Data Set (MYD02, 250 m nominal resolution), the MYD03 Geolocation Data Set (MYD03) and the MYD35_L2 Cloud Mask Data Set (MOD35, 1000 m nominal resolution) [NASA. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data products http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/index.php2016]. 
MYD02 and MYD03 data were processed to produce remote sensing reflectance as described by Hudson et al. [Hudson B, Overeem I, McGrath D, Syvitski J, Mikkelsen A, Hasholt B. MODIS observed increase in duration and spatial extent of sediment plumes in Greenland fjords. The Cryosphere. 2014;8(4):1161-76]. Remote sensing reflectance was then corrected for variations in the solar zenith angle using MYD03 data and was corrected for atmospheric effects via dark object subtraction [Kirk JTO. Light and Photosynthesis in Aquatic Ecosystems, 3rd edition. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; 2011]. Only pixels classified as “confident clear” by MYD03 were included and all images were screened manually for clouds. Individual data sets for the period from 2008 to 2014 were stacked, and time-series extracted for dive site and video transect segment locations.  
We summarized reflectance each year as the 90th percentile of measurements recorded at various time points during the water year (October-September). Reflectance data for water years 2008-2011 were pooled to characterize 90th percentile reflectance before dam removal. Reflectance sample size (i.e., number of clear days) was 129 before dam removal and 24-33 in years after the start of dam removal. For analyses, 90th percentile reflectance for a water year was matched with the biological survey near the end of that water year.</procdesc>

        <methdesc>Ecological data were collected along gradients of expected impact associated with turbidity and sediment deposition east and west of the river mouth, at 3-17 m depths referenced to mean lower low water (MLLW). We also collected data in two control areas where effects of dam removal were expected to be minimal: Green Point, 21 km east of the Elwha River (“Control” and “Dungeness Bluffs”); and Crescent Bay, 15 km west of the Elwha River. 

We evaluated biological and physical habitat changes before and after dam removal at 15 impact and two control sites using SCUBA (hereafter referred to as “dive sites”). Twelve dive sites in the impact area (A1-H2), along with the two control sites at Green Point (GP1 and GP2), were established and surveyed prior to dam removal between 2009 and 2011 and surveyed annually through 2014.  During surveys in 2012, one year after dam removal began, it became clear that dam removal effects on macroalgae extended farther from the river mouth than the previously established impact sites. To better capture the spatial extent of dam removal effects, in 2012 we established three additional impact sites (J, K and L) at locations where macroalgae had been abundant during reconnaissance surveys made in 2008 and were still at least moderately abundant when resurveyed in 2012. All surveys were conducted during summer between 21 July and 12 September.  

Dive sites were marked with a stainless-steel post at the center and concrete pier blocks 50 m to the east and west. Transects were established between the center post and end markers at each site in approximately shore-parallel directions. Surveys were conducted between the 10 m and 40 m points on a measuring tape arrayed between the center post and endpoint marker, with the distal 0-10 m and 40-50 m sections providing buffers to minimize marker-related disturbance.  

We collected benthic community data at each dive site using methods adapted from the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) kelp forest monitoring program [60, 66]. Individual organisms present in a 1-m wide swath along the 30-m transect and exceeding a size threshold (&gt; 2.5 cm in any dimension for invertebrates, and &gt; 24 cm long from holdfast to blade tip for kelp [Laminariales] and acid kelp [Desmarestia]) were identified to the lowest practicable taxonomic level and tallied. When divers were unable to identify taxa in situ, we used underwater photography and taxonomic keys on the surface to resolve unidentified taxa. Species were tallied in 10-m segments within each transect. Abundant species were subsampled by noting the segment length at which 30 individuals were present within a 10-m transect segment. In addition to enumerating taxa as described above, red algae &gt; 24 cm long were classified into four growth forms: branched (flat branching blades), leaf (leafy blade), bushy (cylindrical branches), and lacey (filamentous/dense). Each growth was recorded as present or absent in six 5-m transect segments. We calculated a fleshy red algae presence/absence index for each growth form as the number of segments where the growth form was present divided by six.  

We define primary cover as the surface area of substrate occupied by the attachment structures of vegetation or sessile invertebrates. Percent primary cover was estimated using a uniform point contact (UPC) methodology [60]. At points spaced every 0.5 m along each transect (N=60 points per transect), we recorded the type of organism attached to the substrate or the substrate type (bare rock or bare sand) if it was unoccupied. The UPC methodology was also used to estimate percent secondary cover of brown, red, green, or drift algae. We define secondary cover of macroalgae as the surface area of substrate having macroalgal foliage laying over the substrate but not attached to it. We assessed the presence or absence of foliage of each type of algae at each UPC point.  

Fish were tallied in a 2 m x 2 m moving window as the transect tape was deployed. Additionally, any fish taxa observed during the invertebrate or kelp surveys that were undetected during the fish survey (typically small, cryptic taxa) were included in fish density estimates.  

Finally, each transect was videoed by a diver swimming 1-2 m above the substrate. These videos served as an additional record to corroborate uncertain quantitative estimates, confirm presence/absence data, or otherwise verify in situ data.  

We used a towed underwater video system (Splashcam Deep Blue Pro recorded to Digital8 tape) to assess subtidal changes to marine algae and seagrasses over a broader area of the Elwha River delta. We identified five geographic areas based on geomorphic features and hypothesized effects of reduced sediment input before dam removal. Within each area, five to ten randomly selected transects were run perpendicular to shore to estimate macrovegetation parameters using a line intercept sampling approach. An 11-m shallow-draft vessel traveling at approximately 1 m·s-1 collected imagery of a 1-m wide swath of seafloor along each transect. Spatial positions were logged simultaneously with a differential GPS (Trimble AgGPS 132) and water depth was measured with an echosounder (Biosonics DE 4000). Echosounder depth was adjusted to local MLLW based on observed water levels at NOAA tide station 9444090 in Port Angeles. Each transect was surveyed to a maximum depth of approximately 15 m (MLLW), the deep extent of abundant macrovegetation beds determined from reconnaissance surveys. The minimum depth of transects extended to either the shallowest navigable water depth (about 2 m) or the edge of floating kelp beds (which preclude towed imagery collection due to entanglement). Surveys were conducted in 2010 and annually during 2012-2014 between 8 July and 31 August on days when water clarity was sufficient for high quality video.  

During post processing, a frame from every fifth second of video imagery was classified using a modified Braun-Blanquet scale into five categories of percent cover: &lt; 15%, 15-33%, 34-66%, 67-84%,and &gt; 85%. Vegetation &gt; 10 cm in size was visually identified using a distance-calibrated set of lasers for scale. Over 27,000 images were classified during the four survey years.  

Five categories of vegetation were visually identified: all macrovegetation, kelp in the taxonomic order Laminariales, seagrass species in the family Zosteraceae, green algae, and other red/brown algae. Vegetation categories were generally easy to distinguish based on color and morphology, except the diminutive kelp Laminaria ephemera and ligulate species in the non-kelp genus Desmarestia. These taxa were classified according to the species composition of voucher samples collected with a Van Veen grab in areas where they co-occurred.  

In analyses of biological response at dive sites we treated substrate change as a categorical variable (changed or unchanged). We defined substrate change as bed elevation increase &gt; 10 cm and (or) UPC percent sand increase &gt; 30% (e.g., from 20% to 50%) relative to measurements made before dam removal.  

We evaluated bed elevation change at each dive site using one of two methods. First, at each dive site we pounded a 1 m piece of rebar into the substrate until refusal (typically about 60 cm). We measured (± 2 cm) the distance from the top of the pin to the bed during every site visit. We also estimated bed elevation (± 13 cm) from digital elevation models (DEM) created during bi-annual topography and bathymetry surveys of the Elwha delta. Measurements from DEM were used to assess bed elevation change only at sites where the sediment pin was buried, lost, or dislodged from the substrate.  

Water depth at each dive site before dam removal was used as a covariate in some of our biological analyses. We used water depth estimated from dive computer pressure sensors (rather than from DEM because some sites were beyond the DEM spatial extent) adjusted to MLLW using tide height logged at NOAA Station 9444090. 

We evaluated substrate grain size change at dive sites using two methods. First, we collected a large (typically 1-2 kg) sediment sample at each site using a 15-cm diameter tube pushed 15 cm into the substrate or to refusal. Each sample was allowed to settle for &gt; 12 hours, decanted to remove as much water as possible, transferred to a sample bag and frozen. All samples were analyzed for grain size distributions at the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Geology Science Center (PCMSC) Sediment Laboratory (Santa Cruz, California). Samples were homogenized, split, and run through a Coulter counter and sieves, providing grain size distributions from 0.0001 to 16 mm. 

We also evaluated substrate grain size at each dive site using the UPC method [60]. At 60 points spaced every 0.5 m along each 30-m transect we classified substrate as bedrock, boulder (&gt; 25 cm), cobble (6-25 cm), gravel (0.2-6 cm), or sand (&lt; 0.2 cm).  

We used MODIS satellite imagery and supporting data from the NASA MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS) as a proxy for water column turbidity at dive sites and along towed video transects. Using this proxy was the only way for us to have comparable turbidity data across our study area for the duration of the study. For our analysis we included the MODIS Aqua MYD02QKM Level 1B Calibrated, Geolocated Radiance/Reflectance Data Set (MYD02, 250 m nominal resolution), the MYD03 Geolocation Data Set (MYD03) and the MYD35_L2 Cloud Mask Data Set (MOD35, 1000 m nominal resolution). 

MYD02 and MYD03 data were processed to produce remote sensing reflectance as described by Hudson et al. 2014. Remote sensing reflectance was then corrected for variations in the solar zenith angle using MYD03 data and was corrected for atmospheric effects via dark object subtraction. Only pixels classified as “confident clear” by MYD03 were included and all images were screened manually for clouds. Individual data sets for the period from 2008 to 2014 were stacked, and time-series extracted for dive site and video transect segment locations. 

We summarized reflectance each year as the 90th percentile of measurements recorded at various time points during the water year (October-September). Reflectance data for water years 2008-2011 were pooled to characterize 90th percentile reflectance before dam removal. Reflectance sample size (i.e., number of clear days) was 129 before dam removal and 24-33 in years after the start of dam removal. For analyses, 90th percentile reflectance for a water year was matched with the biological survey near the end of that water year.  

We measured temperature during the study period at Site E1 on the bottom (Fig 1b; depth = 6 m). A Seabird 26+ bursting pressure sensor with a thermistor was deployed on 29 January 2009, recovered and re-deployed at roughly 6 month intervals, and recovered for the final time on 13 March 2011. Temperature observations were logged hourly. Temperature observations were extended beyond September 2011 using an Onset HOBO temperature and light sensor that was recovered and swapped with a new one at 6-12 month intervals; temperatures were logged every 20 minutes. 

We averaged dive survey data from the two transects at each site to obtain a single data point for each site per year. We then averaged over years before dam removal for sites where data were collected for more than one year to obtain a single data point representing initial conditions at each site (hereafter referred to as “Before”). Two data points were missing (site K-Before because K was not surveyed before dam removal and site D1-2014 because D1 became intertidal between the 2013 and 2014 surveys due to sediment deposition); therefore, we used 66 data points for all analyses.  

To assess spatial patterns of vegetation within habitat and depth zones from towed-video surveys, we divided each towed-video transect into contiguous 200-m segments with approximately 30 samples per segment. Transect length varied according to the seabed slope because transects were surveyed to a maximum depth of about 15 m MLLW. At the tip of Ediz Hook, steep bathymetry limited some transects to a single segment of 40 m. For each segment, mean percent cover was calculated based on the midpoint of the cover category for each classified frame. Mean depth per segment was calculated from echosounder depth. The resulting data set comprised one data point for mean cover and mean depth per segment per year (N = 608).</methdesc>
